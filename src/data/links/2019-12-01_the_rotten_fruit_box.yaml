  The fruit youâ€™re enjoying would have otherwise gone unused and rotted away on
  the ground. We also think that the name "Rotten" helps bring attention to the
  serious issue of food waste. Delicious, healthy, 100% natural, with a long
  shelf life, our freeze dried fruit snack pouches are ideal for home, work,
  office, to take to school, camping or just about anywhere. Help reduce food
  waste. Help small local farmers. 100% compostable packaging, ships with your
  local postal service because it is the lowest carbon footprint option.
